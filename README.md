# WindSim

This is the branch made for running longer simulation at higher resolution

It features a (slower) data formater which does not use a lot of memory (which can be convenient when the result file has a size higher than 300Gb)


Run the project with:

```sh
julia --project=. src/OceWind.jl
```


For more infos, go see `README.md` on branch `main`.
